This repository contains my participation in the Du Bois Data Visualization Society Challenge. The goal of the challenge is to celebrate the data viz legacy of [W.E.B Du Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois)—a Black American civil rights activist, sociologist and writer—by recreating the visualizations from the 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools. 
Visit [Github](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/blob/master/challenge/2024/README.md) for full details of each week’s challenge, including the 1900 original plates and the corresponding dataset.
